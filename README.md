# Chronic_Kidney_disease_Analysis

I have developed a model to predict Chronic Kidney Disease in 
patients. It is used to diagnose the Chronic kidney disease based on set of 
attributes (e.g. Blood test samples and urine test samples) using classification 
machine learning techniques. Early diagnostic methodology to determine kidney 
functionality is extremely important for finding the cure of the disease. For this 
task, different classification algorithm is used to diagnose the disease. The goal 
of classification algorithm is to accurately predict the target class for each case 
in the data. Two classification algorithm used for this task are KNN classification 
and Decision Tree classification algorithm.
Dataset
Chronic Kidney Disease dataset is used for this task which is collected from 
various hospitals. This dataset contains 391 instances and 23 attributes with 1 
target attribute. The target attribute has labelled in two-class to represent ckd or 
notckd. This dataset contains blood test samples, urine test samples and blood 
pressure of the patients which are used as input to the classification model to 
predict the chronic kidney disease.
